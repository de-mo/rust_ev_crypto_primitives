//! Crate implementing the cryptographic functions for E-Voting
//!
//! It is based on the specifications of Swiss Post, according to the following document version:
//! [Crypo-primitives](https://gitlab.com/swisspost-evoting/crypto-primitives/crypto-primitives), version 1.4.0
//!
//! The crate reduces actually at the necessary functions for the Verifier. The crate is grouped in modules releated
//! to themes, like the specifications
//!
//! The module `crate::openssl_wrapper` contains a wrapper to openssl. Details about installation and functionalities
//! can be found on the crate [openssl].
//!
//! If a method should return an error, then each error type is specified per module and is transparent
//! to the user of the crate.
//!
//! # Features
//!
//! Following features are possible:
//! - "rug": Use `Integer` of crate [sug](https://crates.io/crates/rug) for mulitple precision numbers
//! - "num-bigint": Use the `BigUint`of crate [num-bigint](https://crates.io/crates/num-bigint) for mulitple precision
//! numbers
//! - "checks": The library will perform checks of the input data, according to the specifications of Swiss Post.
//! This reduces the performance. If the checks are performed during the usage of the crate, it is recommended,
//! not to activate the feature
//!
//! The feature "rug" is strongly more performant, but GMP must be installed for compilation.
//! See the requirements and installation path in the crate documentation [rug](https://crates.io/crates/rug)
